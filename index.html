            <h1>Vayne</h1>
            <span>The nigh hunter</span>
            <p>Shauna Vayne is a deadly, remorseless Demacian monster hunter, who has dedicated her life to finding and
                destroying the demon that murdered her family. Armed with a wrist-mounted crossbow and a heart full of
                vengeance, she is only truly happy when slaying practitioners or creations of the dark arts, striking
                from the shadows with a flurry of silver bolts.</p>

            <h1>Jhin</h1>
            <span>The Virtuoso</span>
            <p>Jhin is a meticulous criminal psychopath who believes murder is art. Once an Ionian prisoner, but freed
                by shadowy elements within Ionia's ruling council, the serial killer now works as their cabal's
                assassin. Using his gun as his paintbrush, Jhin creates works of artistic brutality, horrifying victims
                and onlookers. He gains a cruel pleasure from putting on his gruesome theater, making him the ideal
                choice to send the most powerful of messages: terror.</p>

            <span>The Rogue assassin</span>
            <p>Abandoning the Kinkou Order and her title of the Fist of Shadow, Akali now strikes alone, ready to be the
                deadly weapon her people need. Though she holds onto all she learned from her master Shen, she has
                pledged to defend Ionia from its enemies, one kill at a time. Akali may strike in silence, but her
                message will be heard loud and clear: fear the assassin with no master.</p>
